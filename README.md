# DDG 

Here are my notes for the course: [Discrete Differential Geometry](https://brickisland.net/DDGSpring2022/), offered by CMU.

Instructor: [Keenan Crane](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/)

I tried to take this course as a student would - albeit on a tighter schedule. The sequence of lectures and assignments is given in the [course calendar](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/).

## Assignments

The assignments are split into two major components: 

- Coding: [`/ddg-exercises-js/`](/ddg-exercises-js/)
- Written [`/ddg-exercises-written/`](/ddg-exercises-written/)

## Coding

Opted to use the JS framework, however the C++ one has its merits.

I follow the [official implementation](https://github.com/GeometryCollective/geometry-processing-js) from CMU's Geometry Collective, but with fixes to pass certain test cases and some additional comments to explain things a little better.

## Written

These are effectively my notes for the course, delving slightly deeper into certain topics I found interesting. Some problems are glaringly incomplete (marked `TODO`).

I used many references, and these are informally cited by providing the relevant link.

Many errors still remain. Please don't hesitate to [reach me](mailto:venkatn93@gmail.com) with a fix, pull request, etc.
